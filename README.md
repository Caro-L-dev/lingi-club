# Lingi-club 🗣️

## Introduction 📚

A platform that connects foreign families living in France (often English, German, etc.) with French families who are looking to improve their foreign language skills.
<br/>
The foreign family welcomes for a minimum of one week (in batches of weeks) a member or more of a French family who will live the immersion necessary to learn a foreign language without leaving France.

## Contributing 🤝

If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch from `develop` to test new features. Use a naming convention that clearly describes the feature or fix you're working on. For example, if you're adding a new calendar for registration feature, you might name your branch `feature/registration-calendar`.

2. **Keep `develop` Up to Date**: Before starting work on a new feature or fix, make sure your local `develop` branch is up to date with the remote repository. You can do this by running:  
   `git checkout develop`  
   `git pull`

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've made your changes and tested them, submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.

🚀 Happy coding!
