## Introduction 📚  

A platform that connects foreign families living in France (often English, German, etc.) with French families who are looking to improve their foreign language skills.
<br/>
The foreign family welcomes for a minimum of one week (in batches of weeks) a member or more of a French family who will live the immersion necessary to learn a foreign language without leaving France.
